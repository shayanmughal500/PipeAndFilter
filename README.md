# PipeAndFilter
 The program implements the Pipe and Filter pattern using Java Streams and functional programming. It takes a list of integers as input and processes it through a series of filters applied sequentially. The filters include:  Filtering even numbers.  Squaring the numbers.  Filtering numbers greater than 10.  Filtering prime numbers.  Each filter is represented as a function and applied in sequence, demonstrating a modular and reusable pipeline approach to data processing. The final output is printed after all transformations are applied.
