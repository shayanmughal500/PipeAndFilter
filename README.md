# PipeAndFilter
 The program implements the Pipe and Filter pattern using Java Streams and functional programming. It takes a list of integers as input and processes it through a series of filters applied sequentially. The filters include:
 
## 1. Filtering even numbers.
## 2. Squaring the numbers.
## 3. Filtering numbers greater than 10.
## 4. Filtering prime numbers.

Each filter is represented as a function and applied in sequence, demonstrating a modular and reusable pipeline approach to data processing. The final output is printed after all transformations are applied.
